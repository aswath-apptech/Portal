    <h1>Bhagat_Singh</h1>
    <p>Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907[2][a] – 23 March 1931) was an Indian anti-colonial revolutionary[3] who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in December 1928 in what was intended to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.[4][5] He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and, after his execution at age 23, a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.[6] Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,[7] the charismatic Bhagat Singh[8] electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent, but eventually successful, campaign for India's independence.[9]
